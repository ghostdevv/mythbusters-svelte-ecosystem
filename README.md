I gave this talk at jsmonthly, although I largely just abandoned the slides and did only live coding. I also gave a hopefully better version at Svelte London. If you do want to run these slides you need to open this repo in Obsidian, and then install the [advanced slides](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides) plugin. You should then just be able to run it! The scripts require deno.
